# BWG - Bitcoin Wallet Graph

An easy way to visualize transactions from the blockchain, given a set of bitcoin
public addresses within any number of different wallets.

Data is downloaded from blockchain.com's API and may take a long time for a large
data set because queries to that service are limited to 1 for every 15 seconds.
After the initial download, the data is cached and does not need to be retrieved again.

## Usage

```
parser.py my_wallet1.txt [my_wallet2.txt] [ @other_wallet.txt ]
```

Presently options are not supported but will be soon.

Outputs:
```
file.dot
file-own.dot
file-simplified.dot
```

One can easily convert the text based dot format to pdf using any number of programs,
I use the program from GraphViz, dot:

```
for f in *.dot
do
 dot -Tpdf -Gdpi=600 -o${f%.dot}.pdf 
done
```



## File Formats

parser.py accepts text files for a "wallet" with a list of bitcoin addresses

The name of the file is important for the display of the graph.  The extension 
after the period ('.') is discarded

Every wallet without a an at sign ('@') as the first character is owned and will be
drawn together in a shaded box.

If the file is prefixed with an at sign ('@') then the "wallet" is assumed to be
not owned and so all inputs and outputs are not going to be fully tracked.

If there is a dash ('-') then anything following will be associated in a subgraph
named after the label, and attempted to be drawn together in a box


For example:

A-Wallet.txt
B-Wallet.txt
alpha-ColdWallet.txt
beta-ColdWallet.txt

@C-Exchange.txt
@D-Exchange.txt
@E-Friend.txt

A, B, alpha and beta are all owned so fully tracked with all inputs and output and
transaction fees in the accounting

A, B are further within the 'Wallet' subgraph
alpha, bata are within the 'ColdWallet' subgraph
And both Wallet and ColdWallet are within the OWN subgraph

C and D are in the Exchange subgraph
and E is alone in the Friend subgraph
